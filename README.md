# svg sketch

how hard could it be to make a vector editor that only supported

* basic closed/open fills (i.e. svg default)
* illustrator-style a/shift-c bezier editing
* illustrator-style pathfinder palette

this currently supports *none* of that, it only lets you move a `rect` and `circle` around an artboard, itself a fun experiment in how to build fake ui atop an svg element.

this is just a toy, mostly, an excuse to play around with this sort of minimal app concept and see how to express some of these ui paradigms with redux. a more talented person would make quick work of this.
